- Inability to leverage newer Python ecosystem features
- Potential security vulnerabilities as Python 3.10 approaches end-of-life (October 2026)

**Solution:**  
1. Test compatibility with Python 3.11 and 3.12
2. Update dependencies that may have version conflicts
3. Update CI/CD pipelines if applicable
4. Update documentation and `.python-version` file
5. Update `pyproject.toml` to support newer Python versions

**Dependencies:**  
- All package dependencies must support Python 3.11+
- OSMnx 1.3.0 supports Python 3.11+

**References:**  
- [Python 3.11 Performance Improvements](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython)
- [Python Release Schedule](https://peps.python.org/pep-0664/)

### TD-003: Mixed Import Patterns for H3 Module
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Small (4-8 hours)  
**Category:** Code Quality

**Description:**  
The `src/h3/` module uses an inconsistent import pattern due to naming conflict with the installed `h3` library:
- Comment in `pyproject.toml`: "Import h3 modules using: from src.h3.relationship import ..."
- Not installed as a top-level package
- May cause confusion and import errors

**Current State:**
```python
# pyproject.toml line 40-41
# Note: src/h3 is not installed as a top-level package to avoid conflict 
# with the installed h3 library
```

**Impact:**  
- Developer confusion about import patterns
- Harder to maintain and test
- IDE autocomplete doesn't work properly
- Inconsistent with other modules (config, walk_times, etc.)

**Solution:**  
1. Rename `src/h3/` to `src/h3_utils/` or `src/hex_analysis/`
2. Update all imports throughout codebase
3. Update `pyproject.toml` to include in packages list
4. Update documentation and notebooks
5. Update CI/CD if applicable

**Alternative Solution:**  
Keep namespace separate but document clearly with examples in README

**Files Affected:**
- `src/h3/relationship.py`
- `src/h3/joins.py`
- `src/h3/h3j.py`
- `run_pipeline.sh` (line 155)
- Various notebooks (6, 6b, 6c, 6d)

---

### TD-004: Incomplete Test Coverage
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Large (40-60 hours)  
**Category:** Testing

**Description:**  
Current test suite has significant gaps:
- Only 4 test files exist (`test_walk_times.py`, `test_merging.py`, `test_config.py`, `test_analysis.py`)
- No tests for visualization module
- No tests for H3 module
- No tests for data update/validation scripts
- No integration tests for full pipeline
- No tests for PMTiles conversion
- Missing edge case testing

**Current Coverage Gaps:**
- `src/visualization/` - 0% coverage
- `src/h3/` - 0% coverage  
- `src/update_data_sources.py` - 0% coverage
- `src/validate_data.py` - 0% coverage
- `src/convert_to_pmtiles.py` - 0% coverage
- `src/crop_cejst_to_state.py` - 0% coverage
- `src/probe_data_sources.py` - 0% coverage
- Integration/end-to-end tests - 0% coverage

**Impact:**  
- High risk of regressions when making changes
- Difficult to refactor with confidence
- Hard to validate bug fixes
- No automated quality gates for CI/CD

**Solution:**  
1. Add tests for visualization module (figures.py)
2. Add tests for H3 module (relationship.py, joins.py, h3j.py)
3. Add tests for data management scripts
4. Add integration tests for pipeline
5. Set up pytest-cov reporting
6. Establish minimum coverage threshold (e.g., 80%)
7. Add tests to CI/CD pipeline

**Priority Tasks:**

### TD-005: Hard-coded File Paths and Magic Strings
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Medium (16-24 hours)  
**Category:** Code Quality

**Description:**  
Many scripts contain hard-coded paths and magic strings that make them brittle and hard to maintain:
- File paths like `data/graphs/maine_walk.graphml` repeated across multiple files
- Maine-specific logic (should use `RegionConfig`)
- Magic strings for column names (`"GEOID20"`, `"osmid"`, `"AC_10"`)
- No centralized configuration for defaults

**Examples:**
```python
# run_pipeline.sh line 42-44
graph_path='data/graphs/maine_walk.graphml'
conserved_lands_path='data/conserved_lands/Maine_Conserved_Lands_with_nodes.shp.zip'
```

**Impact:**  
- Difficult to extend to other states
- Error-prone when paths change
- Hard to test with different configurations
- Code duplication

**Solution:**  
1. Extend `RegionConfig` to include all data paths
2. Create configuration module for column name constants
3. Remove hard-coded "Maine" references
4. Use configuration throughout all scripts
5. Update documentation with configuration examples

**Files to Refactor:**
- `run_pipeline.sh`
- `src/run_pipeline.py`
- All processing scripts (`find_centroids.py`, `convert_to_pmtiles.py`, etc.)
- Notebooks that reference specific files

---

### TD-006: Shapefile Format Dependency
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Large (30-40 hours)  
**Category:** Data Format / Technical Architecture

**Description:**  
Project heavily relies on shapefile format (`.shp`, `.shp.zip`) which is:
- Legacy format with known limitations (10-char field names, 2GB file size limit)
- Slower to read/write compared to modern formats
- Multiple files per dataset (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, etc.)
- Less efficient for large datasets

Modern alternatives exist:
- **GeoParquet**: Columnar format, fast, supports complex types
- **GeoPackage**: SQLite-based, single-file, OGC standard
- **FlatGeobuf**: Streaming format, cloud-optimized

**Current State:**
- ✅ `src/migrate_to_geoparquet.py` exists with conversion functionality
- ❌ Migration utility not integrated into pipeline
- ❌ All processing still uses shapefiles
- ✅ PMTiles conversion works from shapefiles

**Impact:**  
- Slower I/O performance for large datasets
- Field name truncation issues
- Multiple files to manage per dataset
- Not cloud-optimized

**Solution:**  
1. Complete GeoParquet migration utility
2. Add support for reading GeoParquet in all processing functions
3. Update pipeline to use GeoParquet internally
4. Keep shapefile support for backward compatibility
5. Update documentation
6. Benchmark performance improvements

**Migration Path:**
1. Phase 1: Support both formats (read/write)
2. Phase 2: Default to GeoParquet for new data
3. Phase 3: Migrate existing datasets
4. Phase 4: Deprecate shapefile as primary format

**References:**
- [GeoParquet Specification](https://geoparquet.org/)
- `src/migrate_to_geoparquet.py` (exists with basic conversion functionality)

---

### TD-007: No Error Handling Strategy
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium (20-30 hours)  
**Category:** Error Handling / Logging

**Description:**  
Inconsistent error handling and logging across the codebase:
- Some functions log errors, others don't
- No centralized exception handling
- Unclear error messages for users
- No error recovery mechanisms
- Failed operations may leave partial data

**Examples of Issues:**
- What happens if OSMnx graph download fails mid-process?
- How are missing geometries handled in walk time calculations?
- What if Census API rate limit is hit?
- No validation of intermediate outputs

**Impact:**  
- Hard to debug failures
- Users don't know why operations failed
- Data corruption risks
- Poor user experience

**Solution:**  
1. Define error handling strategy and patterns
2. Create custom exception hierarchy
3. Add comprehensive logging with levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
4. Add validation checkpoints in pipeline
5. Implement retry logic for network operations
6. Add data validation before/after processing steps
7. Create error recovery guide for common failures
8. Add structured logging (JSON) for monitoring

**Specific Improvements:**
- Add transaction-like behavior for data updates
- Validate schemas before/after transformations
- Add progress checkpoints and resume capability
- Create troubleshooting guide

### TD-008: Incomplete CI/CD Pipeline
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Medium (16-24 hours)  
**Category:** DevOps / Automation

**Description:**  
Partial CI/CD pipeline exists but lacks critical automation:
- GitHub Actions workflow exists for webmap deployment (`.github/workflows/static.yml`)
- Tests must be run manually (no automated test execution)
- No automated quality checks (linting, type checking)
- No test coverage reporting
- No pre-commit hooks

**Current State:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment exists and is functional
- ❌ No automated test execution on PR/push
- ❌ No code quality checks in CI
- ❌ No pre-commit hooks configured

**Impact:**  
- Higher risk of breaking changes
- Manual testing burden
- Inconsistent code quality
- Slower development cycle

**Solution:**  
1. Extend existing GitHub Actions workflow to include:
   - Running tests on PR/push (pytest)
   - Code quality checks (linting, type checking)
   - Test coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
   - Keep existing webmap deployment automation
2. Add pre-commit hooks for:
   - Code formatting (black, isort)
   - Linting (ruff or pylint)
   - Type checking (mypy)
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Add status badges to README

**Priority Tasks:**
1. Add test automation to existing GitHub Actions workflow (pytest on push/PR)
2. ✅ Webmap deployment automation (already implemented)
3. Add code quality checks to CI pipeline
4. Set up pre-commit hooks

---

### TD-009: No Dependency Security Scanning
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Small (4-8 hours)  
**Category:** Security

**Description:**  
No automated security scanning for dependencies:
- Old dependency versions may have vulnerabilities
- No alerts for security updates
- Manual tracking of CVEs

**Solution:**  
1. Add Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency updates
2. Add `safety` or `pip-audit` for vulnerability scanning
3. Add to CI/CD pipeline
4. Set up security policy (SECURITY.md)
5. Regular dependency update schedule

---

### TD-010: Notebook Code Duplication
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Large (30-40 hours)  
**Category:** Code Quality

**Description:**  
Jupyter notebooks contain duplicated logic that should be in modules:
- Walk time calculation code duplicated between notebooks
- Visualization code not fully migrated to `visualization/` module
- Data loading patterns repeated
- Analysis patterns repeated

**Impact:**  
- Harder to maintain and update
- Inconsistent results across notebooks
- Code drift between notebook and module implementations

**Solution:**  
1. Audit notebooks for duplicated code
2. Extract common patterns to modules
3. Update notebooks to use module functions
4. Add notebook testing (nbconvert + papermill)
5. Document notebook → module workflow

**Note:**  
README mentions: "Core data processing logic has been migrated to standalone Python modules in `src/` for better maintainability"
This suggests migration is ongoing but incomplete.

### TD-011: H3 Not Used as Primary Geographic Unit
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Large (72-104 hours)  
**Category:** Architecture / Analysis Methodology

**Description:**  
H3 hexagon infrastructure was built to replace census blocks as standardized geographic units, but the original goal has not been achieved. H3 is currently only used for post-processing aggregation and visualization, while all core analysis still uses census blocks.

**Current State:**
- ✅ H3 relationship file generation exists (`src/h3/relationship.py`)
- ✅ H3 join utilities exist (`src/h3/joins.py`)
- ✅ H3 visualization functions exist
- ✅ H3J format conversion exists
- ❌ Walk times calculated at census block centroids (not H3 hexagon centroids)
- ❌ Access metrics calculated per census block (not per H3 hexagon)
- ❌ Statistical analysis uses census blocks (not H3 hexagons)
- ❌ No H3-centroid mapping to OSMnx nodes

**Impact:**  
- Still subject to uneven census block granularity (urban vs. rural)
- Blocks don't represent meaningful geographic areas
- Blocks can be very small (parks, parking lots) or very large (rural areas)
- H3 benefits (standardized sizes, better comparisons) not realized
- Post-processing aggregation loses precision and accuracy

**Root Cause:**  
The original intent was to use H3 hexagons as standardized geographic units instead of census blocks, which have uneven granularity. However, the implementation stopped at building infrastructure for aggregation rather than making H3 the primary analysis unit.

**Solution:**  
See FR-004 for complete implementation plan. This technical debt item tracks the gap between original intent and current state.

**References:**
- `H3_PROGRESS_ASSESSMENT.md` - Detailed assessment of H3 progress
- Original goal: Use H3 hexagons instead of census blocks for standardized geographic detail

### FR-004: Complete H3 Implementation as Primary Geographic Unit
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Large (72-104 hours)  
**Category:** Analysis Methodology / Architecture

**Description:**  
Complete the original goal of using H3 hexagons as standardized geographic units instead of census blocks. Currently, H3 infrastructure exists but is only used for post-processing aggregation. This feature request would make H3 the primary analysis unit throughout the pipeline.

**Current State:**
- H3 relationship files can be generated (maps blocks to hexagons)

- But walk times, access metrics, and analysis all still use census blocks

**Benefits:**
- Standardized hexagon sizes provide consistent geographic detail
- Better for cross-regional comparisons
- More intuitive for visualization and analysis
- Avoids uneven census block granularity (urban vs. rural)
- Blocks don't represent meaningful geographic areas

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1: H3-Centroid Mapping (Prerequisite) - 8-12 hours**
1. Generate H3 hexagons for the region
2. Calculate centroid for each hexagon
3. Find nearest OSMnx node for each centroid (similar to `find_centroids.py` for blocks)
4. Create `h3_hexagons.shp.zip` with `h3id` and `osmid` columns

**Phase 2: H3-Based Walk Time Calculations - 16-24 hours**
1. Add `geography_type="hexagons"` option to walk time functions
2. Use H3 hexagon centroids instead of block centroids
3. Calculate walk times per H3 hexagon
4. Output: `walk_times_hexagon_df.csv`

**Phase 3: H3-Based Merging and Analysis - 24-32 hours**
1. Create `create_ejhexagons()` function (H3 equivalent of `create_ejblocks()`)
2. Aggregate demographics to H3 hexagons
3. Calculate access metrics per hexagon
4. Join CEJST data at H3 level

**Phase 4: H3-Based Statistical Analysis - 16-24 hours**
1. Update analysis modules to work with H3 hexagons
2. Create H3-based visualization functions
3. Update notebooks to use H3 as primary unit

**Phase 5: Pipeline Integration - 8-12 hours**
1. Make H3 the default geographic unit in pipeline
2. Keep block-level as optional/legacy mode
3. Update documentation

**Dependencies:**
- TD-011 (H3 Not Used as Primary Geographic Unit) - This is the technical debt being addressed
- Existing H3 infrastructure provides foundation

**Alternative Approach:**
- Hybrid: Keep blocks for walk time calculations (more precise), use H3 for aggregation/visualization
- **Pros:** Less effort, maintains precision
- **Cons:** Doesn't fully achieve original goal
- **Effort:** ~40-50 hours

**References:**
- `H3_PROGRESS_ASSESSMENT.md` - Detailed assessment and implementation plan
- `src/h3/relationship.py` - Existing H3 relationship file generation
- `src/h3/joins.py` - Existing H3 join utilities
