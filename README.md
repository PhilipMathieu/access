This project does not yet have complete documentation. At this stage, the best source for information is in the form of the set of Jupyter notebooks available in the [notebooks/](notebooks/) subdirectory.

In the interim, please feel free to contact Philip Mathieu (mathieu.p@northeastern.edu) with questions.
