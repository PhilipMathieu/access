# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Note: This project uses uv for dependency management (pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
# Dependabot uses the "pip" ecosystem which works with uv projects by reading pyproject.toml
# CI workflows use `uv sync` to install dependencies from the lock file
